# Fake news classifier
This is an assignment for the AI module.

"dataset_statements.tsv" is a tab-separated file, containing nearly 13,000 statements made by 
US politicians, taken from the politifact.com web site. A human editor 
has labeled each statement with one of six labels: 
   pants-fire, false, barely-true, half-true, mostly-true, and true.
   
The goal of the project is to build several classifiers and compare their performance.
